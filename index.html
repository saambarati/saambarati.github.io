<h1>Saam Barati</h1>

<p>
I work on programming language implementations.
</p>

<p>
From 2014 to 2022, I worked on WebKit's JavaScript engine, JavaScriptCore (JSC). I worked at Apple for most of that time: from 2015-2022. I worked in all areas of the VM: debugging tools, the garbage collector, all the JS compiler tiers, speculative optimizations, escape analysis, inline caching, the runtime, adding new language features, register allocation, Wasm, security, new benchmarks, and much more. While working on JSC, I was able to develop an expertise in dynamic programming language implementation with strong focuses in performance and security.
</p>

<p>
Starting in September 2022, I'll be working at Epic Games in their compiler and VM group.
